* It will take about 1 hour to quickly go through and try github using following steps 1,2 and 4.
* If with experience, there are two videos in step 4(0), 19 mins and 4(1), 11 mins, which are enough for a quick start.

1. Create account, download and install local software
2. Try webPage interface (4 basic tutorial). https://github.com/
	Notice:
	(1) Tutorials probably contains difference GUI than the version we are using.
	(2) .md format (Markdown basics: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics: )
3. Try Destop interface (Not recommanded. Just using webpage interface and shell scripts is enough for our work)
4. Console scripts

	(1)Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFYyTZwMyAg
	(2)If the video is too fast, Try Git: https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
	(3)Git Cheat Sheet: https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf
5. Here is the best tutorial resource I have found about Github. It takes a long time to finish the whole tutorial, but if we need learn in deep, we need it:

6. Collisions
How to avoid:
1. Always avoid multiple people modify the same part of file at the same time, which means assigning tasks clearly.
2. It is highly recommanded to create a new file, when there will be a lot of modification, not just adding lines in a certain file.
